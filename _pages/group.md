I am always keen to hear from potential candidates who are interested to join my team which mainly focuses on text mining, natural language processing, information retrieval using machine learning methods. The main focus of my team is to propose new methods (novel mathematical models) in machine learning.

My team currently comprises of the following members whom I supervise directly:

1. **Mahsa Abazari Kia**: Mahsa is currently funded by British Telecom and is exploring novel methods in multi-document text summarisation.

2. **António Guilherme Correia**: [António](https://www.inesctec.pt/pt/pessoas/antonio-guilherme-correia) is currently based in [UTAD](https://www.utad.pt/en/), Portugal. He is exploring new methods to model scientific literature and how science has changed over time. He has published extensively in his research area with a paper getting nominated for the best paper award.
