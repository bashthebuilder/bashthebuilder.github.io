I am always keen to hear from potential candidates who are interested to join my team which mainly focuses on text mining, natural language processing, information retrieval using machine learning methods. We propose new methods (novel mathematical models) in machine learning.

My team currently comprises of the following members whom I supervise directly:

1. **Mahsa Abazari Kia**: Mahsa is currently funded by British Telecom and is exploring novel methods in multi-document text summarisation.

2. **António Guilherme Correia**: [António](https://www.inesctec.pt/pt/pessoas/antonio-guilherme-correia) is currently based in [UTAD](https://www.utad.pt/en/), Portugal. He is exploring new methods to model scientific literature and how science has changed over time. He has published extensively in his research area with a paper getting nominated for the best paper award.

I also actively collaborate with the leading people in the academia and industries such as:
1. **Professor Steven Schockaert**: [He](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/133772-schockaert-steven) is the main reason why I am in the United Kingdom. I got an opportunity to be a part of his Euro 1.5 million ERC Starting grant. Together we proposed several novel models to generate new vector spaces or word embeddings which we published in several prestigious venues.

2. **Lidong Bing**: [Lidong](https://lidongbing.github.io/) is based in Alibaba DAMO Academy in Singapore. He is not only my collaborator but also a very close friend. He is an active researcher publishing consistently in leading venues.

3. **Zied Bouraoui**: [Zied](http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~bouraoui/index.html) who is based in CRIL, France. I had got an opportunity to work with Zied at [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/).
