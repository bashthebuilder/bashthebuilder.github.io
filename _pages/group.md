I am always keen to hear from potential candidates who are interested to join my team which mainly focuses on text mining, natural language processing, information retrieval using machine learning methods. We propose new methods (novel mathematical models) in machine learning.

My team currently comprises of the following members whom I supervise or co-supervise directly:

1. **Mahsa Abazari Kia**: Mahsa is currently funded by [BT](https://www.bt.com/) (formerly British Telecom) and is exploring novel methods in multi-document text summarisation.

2. **Mozhgan Talebpour**: Mozhgan is currently an RA on a KTP project with a company. Mozhgan is exploring computational methods to model heterogeneous datasets.

3. **António Guilherme Correia**: [António](https://www.inesctec.pt/pt/pessoas/antonio-guilherme-correia) is currently based in [UTAD](https://www.utad.pt/en/), Portugal. He is exploring new methods to model scientific literature and how science has changed over time. He has published extensively in his research area with a paper getting nominated for the best paper award.

4. **Hamad A Zogan**: [Hamad](https://sites.google.com/view/guandong-xu/stdeunts?authuser=0) is currently a PhD student at [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/). Hamad is exploring novel methods in machine learning to discover depression on social media. [Prof. Guandong Xu](https://sites.google.com/view/guandong-xu/home?authuser=0) is the main supervisor with whom I am collaborating on various topics.

I also actively collaborate with the leading people in the academia and industries, for example:
1. **Professor Steven Schockaert**: [He](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/133772-schockaert-steven) is the main reason why I am in the United Kingdom. I got an opportunity to be a part of his Euro 1.5 million ERC Starting grant. Together we proposed several novel models to generate new vector spaces or word embeddings which we published in several prestigious venues.

2. **Lidong Bing**: [Lidong](https://lidongbing.github.io/) is based in Alibaba DAMO Academy in Singapore. He is not only my collaborator but also a very close friend. He is an active researcher publishing consistently in leading venues.

3. **Zied Bouraoui**: [Zied](http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~bouraoui/index.html) who is based in CRIL, France. I had got an opportunity to work with Zied at [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/).

4. **Professor Wai Lam**: I started my research under [his](http://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-lam-wai/) supervision at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Under his supervision, I have published in various premier conferences and journals. I was a member of the [Text Mining Group](http://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~textmine/) and still work with him and his students on various topics involving text.

5. **Yan Kun**: With Yan, who is currently associated with [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/), works in topics such as image processing. We are together exploring how text information could help improve various tasks in image processing.

6. **Professor Guandong Xu**: I have also recently started collaboration with [Prof. Xu](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/guandong.xu) and his [group](http://dsmi.tech/). Working with his group gives me opportunities to explore novel methods which could be applied to real-world tasks on social media and other datasets.

I occassionally collaborate with some other active researchers such as [Jose](http://josecamachocollados.com/) and [Luis](https://luisespinosa.bitbucket.io/) both based in Cardiff University. They are excellent researchers who explore novel methods on relation extraction from unstructured text.
