##December 25 2019: Alienware Gaming Laptop for Machine Learning##

**This post highlights my experience in using an Alienware R15 laptop for machine learning**

Machine learning, especially deep learning currently is spearheading many research arenas. It is a well known fact that deep learning requires plenty of data powered by some serious hardware support. Just like many of you reading this post, my research considerably revolves around learning new computational models.

When I started as Lecturer in Computing at the University of Kent in December 2017, I was given the option to select only a few machine with meagre hardware. While that machine could help me with my teaching, e.g., using the office applications and make presentaions using Latex, it was far from being a "machine learning beast". So, I decided to buy something where I could seriously run some computational methods quickly.

After a month-long serious searching online, I narrowed down to Alienware supplied by Dell. This was because of the following reasons:

1. Dell at that time was offering high discounts on their Alienware models.
2. Dell allowed me to select hardware components based on what I want.
3. Dell had some of the most recent hardware componets in their armour that time.

The configuration that I bought is this:
