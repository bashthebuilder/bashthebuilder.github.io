Please read the content mentioned below carefully before contacting me for a possible supervision request.


<ol>
  <b><li>Are you accepting PhD students?</li></b>
Yes, I am. Now I am a bit careful before accepting one given I already have a big team to handle including my research.
  
  <b><li>I am self-funded. Will you accept me straightaway?</li></b>
  Being self-funded <b>does not guarantee</b> that you can work with me. I need to assess your research skills before admitting you in my team. As I mentioned earlier, I am very careful now in accepting new members in my team.

 <b><li>How can I work with you?</li></b>
      <ol>
        <li> Please check my profile to identify if your research interests closely align with mine. </li>
        <li> Send me your CV and a short research proposal. </li>
        <li>Wait for my response. </li>
        <li>If you do not receive my response within a week, perhaps you have randomly sent me your documents without even checking my profile.
      </ol>
  
  <b><li>Can I still apply without contacting you?</li></b>
  Yes, you can. However, if you want to work with me, please mention my name as your potential supervisor in your application. You can apply <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/postgraduate/research/applying-to-essex"> here</a> </href>. I will carefully review your application and a decision will follow regarding further steps.

<b><li> What are my minimum entry requirements? </li></b>
While I work mainly with text data, my main speciality lies in Mathematics. I try and propose new methods to model text data. Therefore, I would prefer someone who has a strong grounding in Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, or related subjects. If you have a similar passion, you are the right person to work with me. <em>However, over the years, I have realised that not everyone is alike. Some students who are not very strong initially quickly catch-up with the challenges and do exceedingly well. This is why I tend to not directly reject applications if I see weak Mathematical skills. I try to understand the applicant from various perspectives first, and then interview the applicant to understand the individual even better so that I could make an informed decision.</em>

<b><li> Do you accept short-term interns?</li></b>
Usually, I do not. Given what COVID-19 has taught us, I can discuss a possible remote "unpaid" internship setup with you where you can work on research problems in your campus and I can remotely supervise you. If you do a good job, e.g., you publish a paper at a competitive venue, I will not hesitate to write a letter of recommendation for you.

<b><li>Do you accept visiting students?</li></b>
Yes, I do. Please feel free to contact me regarding this further. It all depends on whether I have set aside some funds for visiting scholars.

<b><li>What it is like working with me?</li></b>
<ol>
  <li> You are free to explore the research topic which you are most passionate about. </li>
  <li> You are free to build your collaborative research network. </li>
  <li> I will ever push you in publishing your findings in top publication venues. I will encourage you to attend conferences regularly. </li>
  <li> You will be encouraged to propose novel mathematical models; and training, if you are already not an expert in proposing novel computational methods. </li>
  <li> I will be closely intertwined to your work: you won't feel ignored! </li>
  <li> A chance to work with my collaborative network comprising of very talented researchers. </li>
</ol>

<b><li> Who is an ideal PhD student in your eyes?</li></b>
<ol>
  <li> Hard working </li>
  <li> Passionate</li>
  <li> Dedicated</li>
  <li> Motivated</li>
  <li> Mentally strong</li>

  <li> Exercises everyday </li>
  <li> Can dance or sing, or play a guitar: an expert in something that is beyond academics and research</li>
</ol>

<b><li>How can I contact you?</li></b>
E-mail is the best channel.
