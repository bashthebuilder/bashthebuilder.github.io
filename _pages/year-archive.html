Please read the content mentioned below carefully before contacting me for a possible supervision request.


<ol>
  <b><li>Are you accepting PhD students?</li></b>
Yes, I am. Now I am a bit careful before accepting one given I already have a big team to handle including my research.

 <b><li>How can I work with you?</li></b>
      <ol>
        <li> Check my profile to identify if your research interests closely align with mine. </li>
        <li> Send me your CV and a short research proposal. </li>
        <li>Wait for my response. </li>
        <li>If you do not receive my repsonse within a week, perhaps you have randomly sent me your documents without even checking my profile.
      </ol>
  <b><li>Can I still apply without contacting you first?</li></b>
  Yes, you can. However, if you want to work with me, please mention my name as your potential supervisor in your application. You can apply <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/postgraduate/research/applying-to-essex"> here</a> </href>. I will carefully review your application and a decision will follow regarding further steps.
<b><li> What are my minimum entry requirements? </li></b>
While I work mainly with text data, my main speciality lies in Mathematics. I try and propose new methods to model text data. Therefore, I would prefer someone who has a strong grounding in Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, or related subjects. If you have a similar passion, you are the right person to work with me. <em>However, over the years, I have realised that not everyone is alike. Some students who are not very strong initially quickly catch-up with the challenges and do exceedingly well. This is why I tend to not directly reject applications if I see weak Mathematical skills. I try to understand the applicant from various perspectives first, interview the applicant to understand the individual even better so that I could make an informed decision.</em>
<b><li> Do you accept short-term interns?</li></b>
Usually, I do not. Given what COVID-19 has taught us, I can discuss a possible remote "unpaid" internship setup with you where you work on research problems in your campus and I can remotely supervise you. If you do a good job, I will not hesitate to write a letter of recommedation for you.
<b><li>Do you accept visiting students?</li></b>
Yes, I do. Please feel free to contact me regarding this further. It all depends whether I have set aside some funds for visiting scholars.
