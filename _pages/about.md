I am a [Lecturer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecturer) (somewhat equivalent to the post of an Assistant Professor in the [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)) in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at the [School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering) in the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/). Before taking up this position, I was a Lecturer in Computing at the [School of Computing](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/) in the [University of Kent](https://www.kent.ac.uk/). Before embarking on a teaching and research journey, I was a [postdoctoral researcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdoctoral_researcher) at the [School of Computer Science and Informatics](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/computer-science) in [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/). At Cardiff, I was working with [Professor Steven Schockaert](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/133772-schockaert-steven). Before coming to the [UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom), I spent approximately six years in [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong) where I completed my [PhD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy) under the supervision of [Professor Wai Lam](http://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-lam-wai/) at the [Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html).

In the summmer of 2019, I was the only academic from the European continent to be invited by [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/) to deliver lectures in their summer school on topics in machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT). I was awarded a full postgraduate scholarship to pursue my PhD research by the [Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management (SEEM)](http://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/). At the CUHK, I have also worked with [Professor Helen Meng](http://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-meng-mei-ling-helen/) as a postdoctoral researcher. Part of my postdoctoral work was supported by [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (MSRA) and the [Government of Hong Kong](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/). While in Hong Kong, I was involved in two large grants as a Co-Investigator. I was the only PhD student in the entire department to participate in the Best Research Awards in Hong Kong sponsored by the Hong Kong Chapter of the ACM and MSRA. At MSRA, I have worked with [Xing Xie](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xingx/) on an [urban computing project](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/urban-computing/). During my undergraduate study, I was awarded a seed-grant as a Principal Investigator to further pursue my research on [text mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining) and natural language processing. I was also interviewed by the Indian national media for my research accomplishments as an undergraduate student showcasing some of the contributions that I made. I did my internship at the Research and Development Division of [Tata Steel](https://www.tatasteeleurope.com/), India where I worked on various novel projects. I was awarded a *Letter of Appreciation* for my excellent contributions to the company.

My **research interests** mainly revolve around playing with and exploring text data emanating from varied sources such as online social networks, news articles, among various other resources. Some of this data could be very large such as the [ClueWeb](https://lemurproject.org/clueweb12/) and some very small such as [20 Newsgroups](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/) each posing their underlying challenges. To learn meaningful information from the text, I propose [novel computational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model) methods - *feel free to use the jargon [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) on text data to describe what you've just read*.

My [PhD thesis](/files/ShoaibJameelPhDThesis.pdf) (and here is the [summary](/files/thesis_presentation.pdf)) contributed to our understanding of the importance of word order in text data. Modelling the word order has become increasingly popular recently, for instance, current state-of-the-art [deep learning models](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) heavily rely on the word order structure in text documents to learn the parameters of the model. We have seen some of the  [path-breaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) results recently in [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) where models capture the order of the words in text documents.

[**Research Keywords**] Machine learning, data mining, text mining, information retrieval, word embeddings, deep learning, graphical models, Bayesian non-parametrics, online social networks.

<span style="color:red"> *I am actively looking for PhD students who would love to be challenged every day during their PhD study. In return, you will get the freedom to explore your research topics, explore collaboration outside my research network, among various others. If you are a prospective student, please feel free to discuss your PhD proposal with me.* </span>
