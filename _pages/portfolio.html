My research explores different computational methods in text mining. In particular, I explore different parametric and non-parametric models to discover interesting patterns from text data. While the data that I work with is primarily text; in terms of applications, I empirically test my novel methods in tasks such as information retrieval, common sense reasoning, classification and clustering, among several others.

My main passion is to propose new mathematical models that pose strong computational challenges. To this end, I propose methods that are scalable and novel. I am passionate about both theoretical and applied machine learning which is evident from my works that propose novel mathematical models followed by a wide range of empirical analysis on different tasks. Some of the findings during my PhD were used to design a conference analytics framework for the speech community.

I am looking for strong PhD students who have a passion for research. I am open to any PhD topic, provided the topic revolves around text and machine learning. Please get in touch with me if you want to pursue your PhD under my supervision.
