I am involved in the [Information Retrieval](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=CE306) (IR) module at my current university. This course is all about indexing, searching, and efficiently retrieving structured and unstructred information given user information needs. The course stresses more on the basic concepts of IR.
